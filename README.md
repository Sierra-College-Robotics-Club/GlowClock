# GlowClock

This is a project from Sierra College Robotics Club, A glow-in-the-dark display, activated by UV LEDs scanning over a glow-in-the-dark surface

See [The Schematic](GlowClockPCB/Docs/GlowClockSchematicPrint.pdf) and [The Code](code/glowClock.py) to get started working with it.

The GlowClock design evolved from our previous project, the Whiteboard Clock, but with the goals of being more mechanically reliable, while showing a new and unique way of using technology we're all familar with: Glow in the dark materials!

The GlowClock is a collaborative effort by the Robotics Club, featuring PCB design and software by Patrick Leiser, with mechanical design and assembly contributions from many talented club members.
